PŘEČTENO:
5.1.1.

space-time-state variables

strategic level: - sociology
what activities to perform and in which order

tactical level: - sociology
short-term decisions based on environment etc.

operational level: - phycics
actual motion of agents

classification of models:
micro/makro/meso-skopic

model characteristics:
micro - each agent separately, individual properties (route choice)
macro - state of the system described by mass density
discrete - integer variable
continuous - real number variable
stochastic - our case, behavior is not determined by state but by propability
rule-based - agents make decision based on the environment and their goals
force-based - they feel force from others in system
fidelity - how much complex agents and intelligent

cellular automata
- all variables discrete, microscopic, ruled-based, stochastic, 
- paralel or synchronous update or random-sequential update

multi-agent systems
- intelligent particles with own configuration

couple-map models
- time discrete and space and state continuous

microscopic forced-based models
- all variables continuous

hydrodynamic models
- all variables continuous, macroscopic
- state - density

gas-kinetic models
- mesoscopic, propability distributions

6.2. OBSERVABLES AND DATA ANALYSIS - distributions
flow J - number of particles crossing site point per unit time
distance-headway - distance between two particles
time-headway - time interval between two particles crossing one point
velocity - speed
density - flow * velocity

6.3.
traffic jams
- bottlenecks - most frequent reason
- spontaneous - crowded places

DIAGRAMS:
- flow / jam
- time / velocity

6.4. FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAM
- density / flow - J(ro) v(ro) v(J)
- zeptat se na třetí graf s více čárami nad sebou

6.5. METASTABILITY / HYSTERESIS
- at peak there is neighborhood which is vulnerable to jams
  and flow is not uniquely determined by density

6.6. LOS - classification by density
- free flow - high speed, flow increased monotonically with density
- congested

6.9 OPTIMAL VELOCITY FUNCTION
- microscopic models - dependancy not only on headway but on local density

6.11 PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT - neglected

7.1
cellular automata (CA):
- time and space discrete, finite number of discrete states
- computational efficiency
- interdisciplinary problems

NaSch:
- parallel updating

- acceleration - v_n = min (v_n + 1, v_max) - tendency to drive as fast as possible
- deceleration - v_n = min (v_n, d_n) - avoid collision
- randomization - v_n = min (v_n - 1, 0) - spontaneous randomization of traffic jams
- vehicle movement - v_n = x_n + v_n

summarization of the rules: x_n(t + 1) = x_n(t) + max[0, min{v_max, v_n(t) + 1, dn(t)} − η_n(t)]

- additional rules needed for complex situations

- configuration depends on both x_t-1 and x_t
- even changing order of the steps above - changing properties of the model
- no possibility for incidents
- maximum shifted to lower densities (more realistic)

- p - deterministic limit - randomization unit

- headway distribution
- distribution of lifetime of jam properties
- choice at definition of jam - v < v_max / v = 0 ...

8.4 CAR FOLLOWING - continuous space - problematické a hodně nestabilní accelerace

- characterized by specifying equations of motion
- force is stimulus (desired velocity / headway..)
- accidents - needed mechanism to avoid it
- optimal velocity for current headway
- ER model with matrix determining new velocity (update of NaSch)
- problem in paralell updating - orderdered sequential updating introduced

- HS model - new acceleration step
- problems: nonmonotonic, collisions,..

9.4. NON-CA CAR FOLLOWING
- each individual vehicle has its own equation of motion
- response from other particles and from environment by stimulus
- physical description of motion for each agent
- environment has big impact

FOLLOW THE LEADER
- particle choose velocity of the leading car
- tends to follow one leader
- bigger speed biger distance
- problem in multilane

OV
- tends to optimal velocity
- fluctuation around optimal velocity
- depends too on position

Social-force
- acceleration depends on individual generalized forces
- velocity-dependant safe distance
- positive and negative velocity difference

11 PEDESTRIAN DYNAMICS
- no limit rules
- interaction with the nearest neighbors mostly (or distant agent moving with collision course)
- preffered speed but may speed up or slow down
- accelerate and slow down instantly
- liesure situations - 1,10m/s
- in crowd - gaussian distribution (sd = 0,26m/s)
- unidirectional flows faster, uphill slower,...
- temperature has effect
- step length approximately 0,65m and depends on speed
- densities in one directional flows not larger than 1,8m-2
- Bidirectional pedestrian flow includes unordered streams, as well as lane-separated and thus quasi-unidirectional streams in opposite directions
- jamming in big density and limited door
- pedestrian occupies 40*40cm


LANE FORMATION
- number of lines change in time
- once a pedestrian is able to pass a bottle neck others can follow him more easily

CA models
- von Neumann neighborhood (common edge) / Moore neighborhood (common corner)

FUKUI-ISHIBASHI model
- bidirectional long way

lane changing:
- side-stepping model - move to empty cell next to him, forward moving pedestrians have priority
- diagonal-stepping model - tries to move diagonaly or as in side-stepping

FLOOR FIELD
motion of pedestrian influenced by:
- disered direction of motion
- interaction with others
- interaction with infrastructure
- 3 components: static field, dynamic field, matrix of preferences

SOCIAL-FORCE MODEL
- most important contribution of force is territorial effect
- description of lane formation and oscilation at bottlenecks
